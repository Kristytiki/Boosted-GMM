# Boosted-GMM
we introduce the Boosted-GMM algorithm, which embeds the EM algorithm in a boosting framework and which can be used to reliably and accurately estimate the class-conditional probabilistic distributions in any pattern recognition problems based on a training data set. We do the simulation to prove that the algorithm We apply the Boosted-GMM algorithm to handwritten digits data set and our experiments show that the recognition rates are effectively and significantly boosted by the Boosted-GMM algorithm as compared to the EM-GMM algorithm due to the fact that boosting can lead to more accurate estimates of the class-conditional GMMs.
